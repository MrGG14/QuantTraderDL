## Project Overview

QuantTrader-TFT uses Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) models to forecast trends in financial indices. By analyzing forecasts with confidence intervals, the project aims to identify indices with high-confidence upward trends, making it possible to build a data-driven, risk-adjusted portfolio. The strategy optimizes returns by selecting indices that are more likely to yield profitable outcomes while managing uncertainty.

## Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for Financial Index Prediction

The **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** is a deep learning model designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It combines attention mechanisms and recurrent layers, effectively capturing short- and long-term dependencies, making it ideal for the nuanced domain of financial forecasting.

### Advantages of TFT in Financial Forecasting

- **Multi-Horizon Forecasting**: TFTs can predict price movements over multiple future time steps, allowing for dynamic strategy adjustments based on anticipated trends.
- **Uncertainty Management**: TFT models provide forecasts with confidence intervals, essential for managing risk in finance. Indices with high-confidence upward trends are prioritized, while those with high uncertainty are treated with caution.
- **Rich Feature Integration**: TFTs can incorporate diverse data sources—including historical prices, technical indicators, and macroeconomic variables—capturing a comprehensive view of factors affecting index movements.

### Variable Types in TFT

To make accurate predictions, TFT models leverage various variable types based on their characteristics and predictability. This structured approach allows the model to treat each type appropriately, enhancing overall prediction accuracy:

1. **Static Variables**: Fixed attributes that do not change over time (e.g., specific index characteristics). These allow the model to capture foundational patterns unique to each index.

2. **Time-Varying Known Variables**: Variables that change over time but whose future values are known, such as calendar dates or economic indicators. These allow the model to account for predictable seasonal effects and scheduled economic events.

3. **Time-Varying Unknown Variables**: Variables that change over time and must be predicted, such as stock prices or technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI). This enables the model to learn from past trends and make informed future predictions.

4. **Lagged Variables and Derived Features**: Values from previous time steps (e.g., moving averages, lagged returns) provide context for recent trends, helping the model detect shifts in market direction or volatility.

### Application to Financial Indices

The TFT model in QuantTrader-TFT leverages these variables to predict trends in major indices, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and IBEX 35. The multi-horizon forecasts generated by the model inform the construction of an investment portfolio that:

- **Maximizes Return**: By identifying high-confidence upward trends.
- **Minimizes Risk**: By managing exposure to indices based on forecast uncertainty.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TFT-QuantTrader.git
    ```

## Common Import Errors and Solutions

When running the script, you may encounter some common import errors. Below is a list of known issues and recommended solutions:

1. **Error**: `Cannot import name '_centered' from 'scipy.signal.signaltools'`
   - **Solution**: Manually define and add the `_centered` function in `scipy.signal.signaltools`:
     ```python
     def _centered(arr, newsize):
         # Return the center newsize portion of the array.
         newsize = np.asarray(newsize)
         currsize = np.array(arr.shape)
         startind = (currsize - newsize) // 2
         endind = startind + newsize
         myslice = [slice(startind[k], endind[k]) for k in range(len(endind))]
         return arr[tuple(myslice)]

     scipy.signal.signaltools._centered = _centered
     ```

2. **Error**: `× Encountered error while generating package metadata.`
   - **Cause**: This can occur when installing `pytorch-forecasting`.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that your Python version is **3.10.x** or lower.

3. **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy.lib.function_base'`
   - **Solution**: Update NumPy to the latest version:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade numpy
     ```

4. **Error**: "A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.0.0 as it may crash."
   - **Solution**: Downgrade NumPy to a compatible version:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy==1.24.3
     ```

5. **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: Optuna's integration modules for third-party libraries have started migrating from Optuna...`
   - **Solution**: Install `optuna-integration`:
     ```bash
     pip install optuna-integration
     ```

6. **Error**: `TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases Callback, PyTorchLightningPruningCallback`
   - **Solution**: Install specific versions of the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install torch==2.0.1 pytorch-lightning==2.0.2 pytorch_forecasting==1.0.0 torchaudio==2.0.2 torchdata==0.6.1 torchtext==0.15.2 torchvision==0.15.2 optuna==3.4
     ```
