## Project Overview

**QuantTrader-TFT** addresses the challenges of quantitative investment strategy development by integrating traditional finance methodologies with state-of-the-art AI techniques. The project consists of three primary components:

1. **QuantConnect Strategies**: A growing repository of algorithmic trading strategies implemented on QuantConnect. These are designed to explore various foundational and advanced concepts in quantitative finance ‚Äî from momentum and mean reversion to factor models and portfolio optimization. While these strategies are kept isolated for educational clarity, real-world systems often combine multiple strategies into a cohesive, risk-aware trading engine.
2.  **TFT Forecasting**: Predicts multi-horizon trends in major financial indices, providing insights into market movements and enabling data-driven portfolio construction.
3. **DRL Trading Bot**: Learns optimal trading strategies through deep reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic responses to market conditions.

## QuantConnect Strategies

The `QuantConnectStrategies/` directory contains a diverse set of algorithmic trading strategies built for the QuantConnect platform. These are used to study the logic and behavior of quantitative strategies in isolation.

### üîç Strategy Categories and Examples

The `QuantConnectStrategies/` directory contains a curated set of algorithmic trading experiments designed to explore diverse quantitative methodologies using the QuantConnect platform. Each notebook reflects a unique research angle ‚Äî from econometric modeling to deep learning and NLP applications.

These strategies are **meant for educational and experimental purposes**, often studied in isolation. In real-world trading systems, the most robust portfolios integrate multiple strategies, risk models, and execution logic.

To facilitate exploration and understanding, the various QuantConnect trading strategies are organized into categories based on their core approach and methodology. This categorization helps to quickly identify strategies that share similar themes, such as momentum, risk management, or machine learning techniques. Each category groups strategies that target specific market behaviors or leverage particular quantitative methods.

## Variables Used for Model Training

This section describes the variables used to train price prediction models and the trading bot. These variables include technical indicators, macroeconomic data, and derived features that capture complex patterns in financial time series.

### Macroeconomic Variables

- **GDP of influential countries**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of several key economies, used to assess the overall state of the global economy and its impact on financial markets.
- **Federal Reserve Interest Rate (FEDFUNDS)**: Reflects U.S. monetary policy and its influence on liquidity and risk appetite.

### Technical Indicators

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:
  - SMA_50 and SMA_200: Price averages calculated over 50- and 200-day windows, respectively. These averages are used to identify long-term trends.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to changes.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: An oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price movements, helping to identify overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions.
- **Bollinger Bands**:
  - Upper and lower bands reflect price volatility over a specific time window.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: A momentum indicator that combines moving averages to detect bullish and bearish crossovers.
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: Measures recent price volatility, providing key information on market risk.
- **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)**: Identifies overbought or oversold levels relative to a statistical average.
- **ROC (Rate of Change)**: Measures the percentage change in price over a specified period.
- **Williams %R**: A momentum indicator showing overbought and oversold levels relative to high and low prices.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Compares the closing price to a range of prices over a period, useful for spotting reversals.

### Derived and Smoothed Variables

- **Gaussian Filters**: Applied to the target price series to smooth out volatility and highlight underlying trends.
  - Gaussian filter formula:

    $$
    \text{G}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}
    $$

    Where \(\sigma\) controls the level of smoothing.
- **Lags of the target variable**: Lagged values of the target price that capture market inertia and repetitive patterns.
- **Smoothed moving averages (target_smoothed)**: Additional smoothing of the target variable to enhance model stability.

### Bullish and Bearish Trends

Signals are generated based on defined rules to identify clear trends:

- **Moving Averages**:
  - Bullish: When SMA_50 > SMA_200.
  - Bearish: When SMA_50 < SMA_200.
- **RSI**:
  - Bullish: RSI < 30 (oversold).
  - Bearish: RSI > 70 (overbought).
- **Bollinger Bands**:
  - Bullish: Price is below the lower band.
  - Bearish: Price is above the upper band.
- **MACD**:
  - Bullish: MACD > Signal Line.
  - Bearish: MACD < Signal Line.
- **ATR**:
  - Bullish: Current ATR > ATR moving average.
  - Bearish: Current ATR < ATR moving average.

### Exogenous Variables

- **External stock indices**: Data from other relevant indices, used as exogenous variables to improve the model's predictive power.

These variables are crucial to capturing the various factors that influence financial market movements, ranging from macroeconomic data to technical signals and derived trends.
